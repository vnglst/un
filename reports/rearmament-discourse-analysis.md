# How Has the World's View on Rearmament Changed?

An analysis of UN General Assembly speeches from 1946-2024, tracking how discourse around military buildup, arms races, and defense spending has evolved over eight decades.

## Executive Summary

Rearmament discourse at the United Nations peaked during the Cold War's final decade (1980s) with 2,248 mentions across 156 countries, then collapsed by 78% in the 1990s following the Soviet Union's dissolution. Today, the conversation has fundamentally transformed: where superpowers once accused each other of dangerous militarization, small neutral nations now critique global military spending as a moral failure that diverts resources from climate and development.

## Methodology

This analysis uses pattern-matching across 200,000+ speech chunks to identify mentions of rearmament-related terms including: rearmament, military buildup, arms race, defense spending, military expenditure, militarization, and weapons acquisition. Terms are weighted by specificity (e.g., "rearmament" = 1.0, "defense budget" = 0.75).

## 1. The Long View: 1946-2024

| Decade | Mentions | Countries | Speeches | Context |
|--------|----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 1940s | 45 | 14 | 26 | Post-WWII reconstruction |
| 1950s | 363 | 66 | 177 | Korean War, early Cold War |
| 1960s | 853 | 116 | 476 | Cuban Missile Crisis era |
| 1970s | 1,259 | 145 | 694 | Détente debates |
| **1980s** | **2,248** | **156** | **1,031** | **Reagan buildup, "Evil Empire"** |

| 2000s | 179 | 86 | 144 | Terrorism dominates agenda |
| 2010s | 158 | 75 | 139 | Climate/refugees overtake |
| 2020s | 109 | 58 | 93 | Slight uptick post-Ukraine |

### Key Observation

The 1980s saw **5x more rearmament mentions** than the 2020s, despite having fewer UN member states. The topic has moved from center stage to the margins of international discourse.

## 2. Who Talks About Rearmament?

### Cold War Era (1980s): Eastern Bloc Dominance

| Country | Mentions | Pattern |
|---------|----------|---------|
| USSR | 75 | Accusing West of arms race |
| Romania | 69 | Warsaw Pact solidarity |
| Ukrainian SSR | 68 | Soviet bloc messaging |
| Byelorussian SSR | 59 | Soviet bloc messaging |
| West Germany | 48 | Defensive posture |
| Bulgaria | 47 | Warsaw Pact solidarity |
| Poland | 39 | Warsaw Pact solidarity |
| Cuba | 38 | Anti-imperialist framing |

**Bloc Analysis (1980s):**
- Eastern Bloc (8 countries): 373 mentions
- Western Bloc (10 countries): 112 mentions
- Non-Aligned/Other (138 countries): 1,763 mentions

The Eastern Bloc mentioned rearmament **3x more per country** than the Western Bloc, using it as a rhetorical weapon against NATO.

### Current Era (2020s): Small Nations Critique

| Country | Mentions | Pattern |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Costa Rica | 8 | Peace advocacy, no military |
| Nepal | 7 | Development priorities |
| Bolivia | 5 | Anti-imperialist stance |
| Holy See | 4 | Moral authority |
| Cuba | 4 | Continued critique |
| Kyrgyzstan | 4 | Development vs. arms |

The discourse has shifted from superpower accusations to **moral critiques by nations without significant militaries**.

## 3. How the Framing Changed

### 1950s: Existential Fear
> "The tests themselves, that is, the perfecting of atomic weapons already constitutes a direct mortal danger to the health of mankind."
> — Bulgaria, 1958

### 1980s: Ideological Warfare
> "The thirty-eighth session must make its contribution to curbing the arms race and normalizing the international situation...the prevention of nuclear war, an early halt to the arms race."
> — Ukraine, 1983

> "Dependence compels all of us to desist from trying to dominate others, to desist from an arms race and reject the arrogance of power."
> — West Germany, 1988

### 2020s: Opportunity Cost Critique
> "Global military expenditures have risen to record levels reaching $2.24 trillion. That reflects the strategic trust deficit among the powerful. Key arms control frameworks that were instrumental in maintaining system stability have collapsed."
> — Sri Lanka, 2023

> "We should not increase military spending, leading to further escalation of conflicts and disasters. Instead, we must direct our efforts toward building a just, safe, and prosperous world for all."
> — Kyrgyzstan, 2024

> "The Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan represents only 0.03% of global military spending, which in 2023 reached $2.44 trillion."
> — Costa Rica, 2024

### The Transformation

| Era | Framing | Primary Speakers | Target |
|-----|---------|------------------|--------|
| Cold War | Existential threat, superpower competition | Major powers | Opposing bloc |
| Post-Cold War | Peace dividend, disarmament opportunity | Global | Arms industry |
| 2020s | Moral failure, misallocated resources | Small nations | All major powers |

## 4. Rearmament vs. Disarmament Balance

The ratio of rearmament to disarmament mentions reveals shifting priorities:

| Decade | Rearmament | Disarmament | Rearm % | Interpretation |
|--------|------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 1950s | 363 | 1,165 | 24% | Hope for disarmament |
| 1960s | 853 | 2,675 | 24% | Arms control focus |
| 1970s | 1,259 | 2,304 | 35% | Détente tensions |
| **1980s** | **2,248** | **2,993** | **43%** | **Peak anxiety** |
| 1990s | 484 | 1,950 | 20% | Peace dividend |
| 2000s | 179 | 985 | 15% | Terrorism agenda |
| 2010s | 158 | 816 | 16% | Climate agenda |
| 2020s | 109 | 247 | 31% | Rising concern |

### Notable Pattern

The 2020s show **rising rearmament concern** (31%) compared to the 2000s-2010s (15-16%), but the absolute numbers remain low. The Ukraine war has not (yet) triggered a return to Cold War-level discourse.

## 5. Term Evolution

### 1980s: "Arms Race" Dominated
| Term | Occurrences |
|------|-------------|
| arms race | 1,453 |
| militarization | 112 |
| military expenditure | 57 |
| conventional armament | 48 |
| nuclear armament | 40 |

### 2020s: More Diverse Vocabulary
| Term | Occurrences |
|------|-------------|
| arms race | 35 |
| military spending | 18 |
| militarization | 13 |
| military expenditure | 6 |
| military build-up | 4 |

"Arms race" remains the dominant term but "military spending" has gained ground—reflecting the shift from strategic competition framing to fiscal/moral framing.

## 6. The Ukraine Factor

Year-by-year mentions around the 2022 Russian invasion:

| Year | Mentions | Countries |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2018 | 14 | 13 |
| 2019 | 23 | 22 |
| 2020 | 15 | 11 |
| 2021 | 20 | 19 |
| 2022 | 17 | 15 |
| 2023 | 23 | 20 |
| **2024** | **34** | **28** |

The invasion did not cause an immediate spike, but 2024 shows **doubled mentions** compared to 2022, with more countries engaging.

### Ukraine's Own Discourse

Notably, Ukraine's mentions focus on **regretting past disarmament**, not advocating current rearmament:

> "Ukraine voluntarily dismantled its own nuclear arsenal — the third largest in the world at the time, with between 2,800 and 4,200 tactical nuclear warheads — in exchange for security, sovereignty and territorial integrity assurances."
> — Ukraine, 2016

## 7. Key Findings

### Finding 1: The Conversation Migrated
Cold War rearmament discourse was dominated by major powers accusing each other. Today's discourse comes primarily from small, neutral nations critiquing the global system.

### Finding 2: From Strategy to Morality
The framing shifted from "your country is arming dangerously" to "humanity spends too much on weapons instead of addressing climate change and poverty."

### Finding 3: Absolute Decline, Relative Rise
While raw mentions remain far below Cold War levels, rearmament's share of military discourse has increased from 15% (2000s) to 31% (2020s)—suggesting renewed concern.

### Finding 4: Ukraine's Delayed Impact
The 2022 invasion didn't trigger immediate discourse change, but 2024 shows significant growth. The full impact may still be unfolding.

### Finding 5: Eastern Bloc Legacy
The nations that most frequently discussed rearmament (USSR, Eastern European states) no longer exist in their Cold War form. No comparable bloc drives the discourse today.

## Limitations

1. **No sentiment analysis**: We can identify who mentions rearmament but not whether they support or oppose it. LLM-based stance classification would add this dimension.

2. **Term coverage**: Some euphemisms or new terminology may be missed. The concept dictionary could be expanded.

3. **Context collapse**: A mention of "arms race" in a historical reference is counted the same as a policy argument.

4. **Translation effects**: Non-English speeches are translated, potentially affecting term consistency.
