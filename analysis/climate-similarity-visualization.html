We made that our priority, and one year later we are keeping that promise.
From the day I came to office, we have led with a bold climate agenda. We rejoined the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, convened major climate summits, helped deliver critical agreements on the twenty- sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and helped get two thirds of the world‚Äôs gross domestic product on track in order to limit global warming to 1.5¬∞C.
And now I have signed a historic piece of legislation here in the United States that includes the biggest, most important climate commitment we have ever made in the history of our country: $369 billion allocated to climate change. That includes allocating tens of billions of dollars for new investments in offshore wind and solar energy, doubling down on zero-emission vehicles, increasing energy efficiency and supporting clean manufacturing.
Our Department of Energy estimates that this new law will reduce United States emissions by one gigaton a year by 2030, while unleashing a new era of clean- energy-powered economic growth. Our investments will also help reduce the cost of developing clean- energy technologies worldwide, not just in the United States. That is a global game changer ‚Äî and none too soon. We do not have much time.
We all know that we are already living in a climate crisis. No one seems to doubt it after this past year. As we meet, much of Pakistan is still under water. It needs help. Meanwhile, the Horn of Africa faces unprecedented drought. Families are facing impossible choices, choosing which child to feed and wondering whether they will survive.</div>

My heart goes out to the people of Libya. Together, those snapshots tell an urgent story of what awaits us if we fail to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and do not begin to climate-proof the world. From day one. my United States Administration has treated this crisis as an existential threat, from the moment we took office ‚Äî not for us only, but for all of humankind.
Last year I signed into law in the United States the largest investment ever and anywhere in the history of the world ‚Äî to combat the climate crisis and help move the global economy towards a clean energy future. We are also working with the Congress to quadruple our climate financing in order to help developing countries reach their climate goals and adapt to climate impacts. And this year, the world is on track to meet the climate finance pledge made, collectively, under the Paris Agreement ‚Äî to raise $100 billion.
But we need more investment from the public and private sector alike, especially in places that have contributed so little to global emissions, but face some of the worst effects of climate change, like the Pacific Islands. The United States is working directly with the Pacific Island Forum to help those nations adapt and build resilience to the climate impact, even as we lead the effort to build innovative new partnerships that attack the global challenges from all sides. Those range from the First Movers Coalition, which is mobilizing billions of dollars in private sector commitments to create a market demand for green products in carbon-intense sectors like concrete, shipping, aviation and trucking; to the Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate, which is bringing farmers into the climate solution and making our food supply more resilient to climate shocks; to the Global Methane Pledge, now endorsed by more than 150 count</div>

We will then have to continue raising our collective ambition over time.
In April, I announced the United States ambitious new goal under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the United States by 50 to 52 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, as we work towards achieving the clean energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050. My Administration is working closely with our Congress to make critical investments in green infrastructure and electric vehicles that will help us lock in progress at home towards our climate goals. The best part is that making those ambitious investments is not just good climate policy. It is a chance for every one of our countries to invest in ourselves and our own future. It is an enormous opportunity to create good paying jobs for workers in every one of our countries and spur longterm economic growth that will improve the quality of life for all of our people.
We also have to support the countries and people that will be hit the hardest and have the fewest resources to help them adapt. In April, I announced that the United States would double its public international financing to help developing nations tackle the climate crisis. Today, I am proud to announce that we will work with the Congress to double that number again, including for adaptation efforts. That will make the United States a leader in public climate finance and, with our added support together with increased private capital from other donors, we will be able to meet the goal of mobilizing $100 billion to support climate action in developing nations.
As we deal with those crises, we are also encountering a new era of new technologies and possibilities that have the potential to release and reshape every aspect of human existence.</div>

It is all within our capacity.
We need to bring that same commitment, urgency and ambition as we work together to meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Those Goals were adopted at the United Nations in 2015 (resolution 70/1) as a road map for improving lives around the world. But the hard truth is that for decades of progress, the world has lost ground these past years, in the wake of the coronavirus disease pandemic, conflicts and other crises.
The United States is committing to doing its part to get us back on track. All told, in the first two years of my Administration, the United States has invested more than $100 billion to drive development progress and bolster food security, expanding access to education worldwide, strengthening health-care systems and fighting disease, and we have helped mobilize billions more in private sector investments.
But to accelerate our forward progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, we all have to do more. We need to build new partnerships that change the way we tackle this challenge in order to unlock trillions of additional financing for development, drawing on all sources. We need to fill the gaps and address the failures of our existing system, exposed by the pandemic. We need to ensure that women and girls benefit fully from our progress. We must also do more to grapple with the debt that holds back so many lows- and middle-income countries. When nations are forced to service unsustainable debt payments over the needs of their own people, it makes it harder for them to invest in their own futures.</div>

The United States has already put more than $15 billion towards the global COVID-19 response. We have shipped more than 160 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to other countries. That includes 130 million doses from our own supply and the first tranche of a half-billion doses of Pfizer vaccine that we purchased to donate through the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility.
Planes carrying vaccines from the United States have already landed in 100 countries, bringing people all over the world a ‚Äúlittle dose of hope‚Äù, as one American nurse termed it to me ‚Äî a dose of hope direct from the American people and, importantly, with no strings attached. Tomorrow, at the United States-hosted Global Summit to End COVID-19, I will announce additional commitments, as we seek to advance the fight against COVID-19 and hold ourselves accountable around
specific targets on three key challenges: saving livings now, vaccinating the world and building back batter.
This year has also brought widespread death and devastation from the borderless climate crisis. The extreme weather events that we have seen in every part of the world, which everyone here knows and feels, represent what the Secretary-General rightly called ‚Äúcode red for humankind‚Äù. The scientists and experts are telling us that we are fast approaching a point of no return, in a literal sense. To keep within our reach the vital goal of limiting global warming to 1.5¬∞C, every nation needs to bring its highest possible ambitions to the table when we meet in Glasgow for the twenty- sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</div>

For example, the Lobito corridor will extend across Africa ‚Äî from the western port of Angola, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Zambia‚Äîboosting regional connectivity and strengthening commerce and food security in Africa. Similarly, the groundbreaking effort we announced at the G20 to connect India to Europe through the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia. Jordan and Israel will spur opportunities for investment across two continents.
That is part of our effort to build a more sustainable, integrated Middle East. It demonstrates how Israel‚Äôs greater normalization and economic connection with its neighbours is delivering positive and practical impacts, even as we continue to work tirelessly to support a just and lasting peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, with two States for two peoples. Now let me be clear ‚Äî none of these partnerships are about containing any country; they are about a positive vision for our shared future.
When it comes to China. I want to be clear and consistent. We seek to responsibly manage the competition between our countries so that it does not tip into conflict. As I have said before, we are for de-risking, not decoupling with China. We will push back on aggression and intimidation and defend the rules of the road ‚Äî from freedom of navigation to overflight, to a level economic playing field, which have helped safeguard security and prosperity for decades ‚Äî but we also stand ready to work together with China on issues where progress hinges on our common efforts.
Nowhere is that more critical than the accelerating climate crisis. We see it everywhere ‚Äîrecord-breaking heat waves in the United States and China, wildfires ravaging North America and southern Europe, a fifth year of drought in the Horn of Africa and tragic flooding in Libya that has killed many thousands of people. My heart goes out to the people of Libya.</div>

Families are facing impossible choices, choosing which child to feed and wondering whether they will survive. That is the human cost of climate change ‚Äî and it is growing, not lessening.
Therefore, as I announced last year, in order to meet our global responsibility, my Administration is working with our Congress to deliver more than $11 billion a year to international climate financing to help lower- income countries implement their climate goals and ensure a just energy transition. The key part of that will be the President‚Äôs Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience plan, which will help half a billion people, especially vulnerable countries, to adapt to the impacts of climate change and build resilience. That need is enormous. Let this therefore be the moment when we find within ourselves the will to turn back the tide of climate devastation and unlock a resilient, sustainable and clean energy economy to preserve our planet.
With regard to global health, we delivered more than 620 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to 116 countries around the world, with more available to help meet countries‚Äô needs, all of it free of charge with no strings attached. We are also working closely with the Group of 20 and other countries. And the United States has helped take the lead in establishing the ground-breaking new financial intermediary fund for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response at the World Bank.
At the same time, we have continued to advance the ball on enduring global health challenges. Later today, I will host the seventh Replenishment Conference of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. With bipartisan support in our Congress, I have pledged to contribute up to $6 billion to that effort.</div>

Under the new President of the World Bank, change is already taking root. Last month. I asked the United States Congress for additional funds to expand World Bank financing by $25 billion. At the Group of 20 (G20). we rallied the major economies of the world to mobilize even more funding. Collectively, we can deliver a transformational boost to World Bank lending. And because the multilateral development banks are among the best tools we have for mobilizing transparent high- quality investment in developing countries, reforming those institutions can be a game-changer.
Similarly, we proposed making sure developing countries have a strong voice and representation at the International Monetary Fund. We are going to continue our efforts to reform the World Trade Organization and preserve competition, openness, transparency and the rule of law. while at the same time equipping it to better tackle modern-day imperatives such as driving a clean energy transition, protecting workers and promoting inclusive and sustainable growth. And this month, we strengthened the G20 as a vital forum, welcoming the African Union as a permanent member.
However, upgrading and strengthening our institutions is only half the picture. We must also forge new partnerships and confront new challenges. Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, hold both enormous potential and enormous peril. We need to be sure they are used as tools of opportunity, not as weapons of oppression. Together with leaders around the world, the United States is working to strengthen rules and policies so artificial intelligence technologies are safe before they are released to the public to make sure we govern the technology, not the ot</div>

We meet this year in a moment of great pain intermingled with extraordinary possibility. We have lost so much to a devastating pandemic that continues to claim lives around the world and has such great impact on our existence. We are mourning more than 4.5 million people ‚Äî people of every nation and from every background.
Each death is an individual heartbreak, but our shared grief is a poignant reminder that our collective future will hinge on our ability to recognize our common humanity and to act together. This is the clear and urgent choice that we face today at the dawning of what must be a decisive decade for our world ‚Äî a decade that will quite literally determine our futures.
As a global community, we are challenged by urgent and looming crises, wherein lie enormous opportunities if we can summon the will and resolve to seize these opportunities. Will we work together to save lives, defeat the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) everywhere and take the necessary steps to prepare ourselves for the next pandemic? For there will be another one. Or
will we fail to harness the tools at our disposal, as the more virulent and dangerous variants take hold?
Will we meet the threat of the challenging climate we are all already feeling ravaging every part of our world with extreme weather? Or will we suffer the merciless march of ever worsening droughts and floods, more intense fires and hurricanes, longer heat waves and rising seas?
Will we affirm and uphold the human dignity and human rights under which nations in common cause more than seven decades ago formed this institution? Will we apply and strengthen the core tenets of the international system, including the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as we seek to shape the emergence of new technologies and deter new threats?

Those are the challenges that will determine what the world looks like for our children and our
grandchildren and what they will inherit. We can meet them only by looking to the future.
I stand in this Hall today, for the first time in 20 years, with the United States not at war. We have turned the page. All the unmatched strength, energy, commitment, will and resources of our nation are now fully and squarely focused on what is ahead of us, not what was behind.
I know this ‚Äî as we look ahead, we will lead. We will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time, from COVID-19 to climate, peace and security, human dignity and human rights. But we will not go it alone. We will lead together with our allies and partners and in cooperation with all those who believe, as we do, that it is within our power to meet those challenges and to build a future that lifts all our people and preserves this planet.
But none of this is inevitable; it is a choice. And I can tell Member States where America stands. We will choose to build a better future. We, all together, have the will and capacity to make it better. We cannot afford to waste any more time. Let us get to work. Let us make our better future now. We can do this.
