Our thoughts turn to the same question that ran through all their speeches and resolutions, through every word and every hope. It is a question of what kind of world we will leave for our children and what kind of nations they will inherit. The dreams that fill this Hall today are as diverse as the people that have stood at this rostrum, and as varied as the countries represented here in this body. It really is something. It really is great history.\nThere  is  India,  a  free  society  with  more  than 1 billion people, successfully lifting countless millions out of poverty and into the middle class. There is Saudi Arabia, where King Salman and the Crown Prince are pursuing bold new reforms. There is Israel, proudly celebrating its seventieth anniversary as a thriving democracy in the holy land. In Poland, a great people are standing up for their independence, security and sovereignty.

In less than two years, my Administration has accomplished more than almost any Administration in the history of our country.\nAmerica’s economy is booming like never before. Since my election, we have added $10 trillion in wealth. The stock market is  at  an all-time high in history, and jobless claims are at a 50-year low. African- American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all achieved their lowest levels ever recorded. We have added more than 4 million new jobs, including half a million manufacturing jobs. We passed the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. We started the construction of a major border wall and we have greatly strengthened border security. We have secured record funding for our military — $700 billion this year and $716 billion next year. Our military will soon be more powerful than it has ever been before.\nIn other words, the United States is a stronger, safer and richer country than it was when I assumed office less than two years ago. We are standing up for America and for the American people. We are also standing up for the world. This is great news for our citizens and for peace-loving people everywhere.

For decades, the United States opened its economy — the largest, by far, on Earth — with few conditions. We allowed foreign goods from all over the world to flow freely across our borders. Yet other countries did not grant us fair and reciprocal  access to  their markets  in return. Even worse, some countries abused their openness to dump their products, subsidize their goods, target our industries and manipulate their currencies to gain unfair advantage over our country. As a result, our trade deficit ballooned to nearly $800 billion a year. For that reason, we are systematically renegotiating broken and bad trade deals.\nLast month, we announced a ground-breaking United States-Mexico trade agreement. And just yesterday, I\nstood with President Moon to announce the successful completion of the brand new United States-Korea trade deal. And that is just the beginning. Many nations in this Hall will agree that the world trading system is in dire need of change. For example, countries were admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that violate every single principle on which the organization is based. While the United States and many other nations play by the rules, those countries use Government-run industrial planning and State-owned enterprises to rig the system in their favour. They engage in relentless product dumping, forced technology transfer and the theft of intellectual property.\nThe United States lost more than 3 million manufacturing jobs, nearly a quarter of all steel jobs and 60,000 factories after China joined the  WTO.",

As we see in Jordan, the most compassionate policy is to place refugees as close to their homes as possible to ease their eventual return as part of the rebuilding process. This approach also stretches finite resources to help far more people, increasing the impact of every dollar spent.\nEvery solution to the humanitarian crisis in Syria must also include a strategy to address the brutal regime that has fuelled and financed it: the corrupt dictatorship in Iran. Iran’s leaders sow chaos, death and destruction. They do not  respect their neighbours or  borders or  the sovereign rights of nations. Instead, Iran’s leaders plunder the nation’s resources to enrich themselves and spread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond. The Iranian people are rightly outraged that their leaders have embezzled billions of dollars from Iran’s treasury, seized valuable portions of the economy and looted the people’s religious endowments — all to line their own pockets and send their proxies to wage war.

At the Group of 20 (G20). we rallied the major economies of the world to mobilize even more funding. Collectively, we can deliver a transformational boost to World Bank lending. And because the multilateral development banks are among the best tools we have for mobilizing transparent high- quality investment in developing countries, reforming those institutions can be a game-changer.\nSimilarly, we proposed making sure developing countries have a strong voice and representation at the International Monetary Fund. We are going to continue our efforts to reform the World Trade Organization and preserve competition, openness, transparency and the rule of law. while at the same time equipping it to better tackle modern-day imperatives such as driving a clean energy transition, protecting workers and promoting inclusive and sustainable growth.

And this year, the world is on track to meet the climate finance pledge made, collectively, under the Paris Agreement — to raise $100 billion.\nBut we need more investment from the public and private sector alike, especially in places that have contributed so little to global emissions, but face some of the worst effects of climate change, like the Pacific Islands. The United States is working directly with the Pacific Island Forum to help those nations adapt and build resilience to the climate impact, even as we lead the effort to build innovative new partnerships that attack the global challenges from all sides. Those range from the First Movers Coalition, which is mobilizing billions of dollars in private sector commitments to create a market demand for green products in carbon-intense sectors like concrete, shipping, aviation and trucking; to the Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate, which is bringing farmers into the climate solution and making our food supply more resilient to climate shocks; to the Global Methane Pledge, now endorsed by more than 150 count",

My Administration is working closely with our Congress to make critical investments in green infrastructure and electric vehicles that will help us lock in progress at home towards our climate goals. The best part is that making those ambitious investments is not just good climate policy. It is a chance for every one of our countries to invest in ourselves and our own future. It is an enormous opportunity to create good paying jobs for workers in every one of our countries and spur longterm economic growth that will improve the quality of life for all of our people.\nWe also have to support the countries and people that will be hit the hardest and have the fewest resources to help them adapt. In April, I announced that the United States would double its public international financing to help developing nations tackle the climate crisis. Today, I am proud to announce that we will work with the Congress to double that number again, including for adaptation efforts. That will make the United States a leader in public climate finance and, with our added support together with increased private capital from other donors, we will be able to meet the goal of mobilizing $100 billion to support climate action in developing nations.\nAs we deal with those crises, we are also encountering a new era of new technologies and possibilities that have the potential to release and reshape every aspect of human existence.",

All told, in the first two years of my Administration, the United States has invested more than $100 billion to drive development progress and bolster food security, expanding access to education worldwide, strengthening health-care systems and fighting disease, and we have helped mobilize billions more in private sector investments.\nBut to accelerate our forward progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, we all have to do more. We need to build new partnerships that change the way we tackle this challenge in order to unlock trillions of additional financing for development, drawing on all sources. We need to fill the gaps and address the failures of our existing system, exposed by the pandemic. We need to ensure that women and girls benefit fully from our progress.

We have to bring in more leadership and capability, which exists everywhere, especially from the regions that not have not always been fully included. We have to grapple with challenges that are more connected and more complex. And we have to make sure we are delivering for people everywhere, not just people somewhere.\nSimply put. twenty-first century results are badly needed to move us along. That starts with the United Nations. That starts right here in this Hall. In my address to this body last year (see A/77/PV.6). I announced that the United States would support expanding the Security Council by increasing the number of permanent and non-permanent members. The United States has undertaken serious consultations with many Member States and will continue to do its part to push more reform efforts forward, look for points of common ground and make progress in the year ahead. We need to be able to break the gridlock that too often stymies progress and blocks consensus in the Council. We need more voices and more perspectives at the table.\nThe United Nations must continue to preserve peace, prevent conflict and alleviate human suffering. We embrace nations stepping up to lead in new ways and to seek new breakthroughs on hard issues. For example, on Haiti, the Caribbean Community has facilitated a dialogue among Haitian society. I thank President Ruto of Kenya for his willingness to serve as the lead nation of a United Nations-backed security support mission. I call on the Security Council to authorize that mission now. The people of Haiti cannot wait much longer.\nThe United States is working across the board to make global institutions more responsive, more effective and more inclusive. For example, we have taken significant steps to reform and scale up the World Bank, expanding its financing to low- and middle-income countries so it can help to boost progress towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals and bett",

Or will we allow those universal principles to be twisted and trampled upon in the pursuit of naked political power?\nIn my view, how we answer these questions in this moment, whether we choose to fight for our shared future or not, will reverberate for generations yet to come. Simply put, we stand, in my view, at an inflection point in history. And I am in this Hall today to share with the General Assembly of the United Nations how the United States intends to work with partners and allies to answer these questions and the commitment of my new Administration to helping to lead the world toward a more peaceful, prosperous future for all people.\nInstead of continuing to fight the wars of the past, we are fixing our eyes on devoting our resources to the challenges that hold the keys to our collective future: ending this pandemic, addressing the climate crisis, managing the shifts in global power dynamics, shaping the rules of the world on vital issues like trade, cyberactivity and emerging technologies, and facing the threat of terrorism as it stands today.\nWe have ended 20 years of conflict in Afghanistan, and as we close this period of relentless war, we are opening a new era of relentless diplomacy, of using the power of our development aid to invest in new ways of lifting people up around the world, of renewing and defending democracy, of proving that, no matter how challenging or complex the problems we are going to face, government by and for the people is still the best way to deliver for all of our peoples.\nAs the United States turns its focus to the priorities and regions of the world that are most consequential\ntoday and tomorrow, such as the Indo-Pacific, we will do so with our allies and partners through cooperation and multilateral institutions like the United Nations to amplify our collective strength and speed our progr",

The United States wants to work with all who are still committed to a strong foundation for the good of every nation around the world.\nI also believe the time has come for this institution to become more inclusive so that it can better respond to the needs of today’s world. Members of the Security Council, including the United States, should consistently uphold and defend the Charter and refrain — I repeat — refrain from the use of the veto, except in rare, extraordinary situations, in order to ensure that the Council remains credible and effective. That is also why the United States supports increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent representatives of the Council. That includes granting permanent seats to those nations we have long supported to receive them, as well as to countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.\nThe United States is committed to that vital work. In every region, we have pursued new, constructive ways to work with partners to advance shared interests — from elevating the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue in the Indo-Pacific and signing the Los Angeles Declaration of Migration and Protection at the Summit of the Americas, to joining a historic meeting of nine Arab leaders to work towards a more peaceful and integrated Middle East and hosting the United States- Africa Leaders Summit scheduled for December.\nAs I said last year (see A/76/PV.3), the United States is opening an era of relentless diplomacy to address the challenges that matter most to people’s lives — all people’s lives — including tackling the climate crisis, as the previous speaker spoke to; strengthening global health security; and feeding the world — I repeat — feedi",
