- **speeches**: Main table containing speech data (country, year, session, speaker, text)
- **speeches_fts**: Full-text search index for efficient text searching
- **chunks**: Speeches split into ~1500 char segments for semantic search
- **chunk_embeddings**: 384-dim vectors (bge-small-en-v1.5) for RAG search
- **quotations**: Extracted quotes from notable figures (used in research pages)

## 🚢 Deployment
