> "by day and by night, fleeing or at rest, in peace or in war”. That is why, in this period of urgent problems, there is no hope for salvation and international security save in the rule of law, freely agreed on between equals and faithfully observed. Those who believe that, disregarding and disavowing it, they can affirm their supremacy will soon discover that they have laboured in vain and they will discover, too, that those who create violence, destroy order and shatter peace are doomed to perish, no matter how lofty or plausible their motives may appear. After two world wars and with a third in prospect, it is not governments, whether despotic or democratic, in whose hands the final decision will rest, but the people, who neither want, nor deserve nor will allow themselves to be led to destruction and death.
9.	In this crisis, which is not the first and will not be the last in the history of mankind, the worst thing we could do would be to adopt a pessimistic approach. There is no finer hour of human existence than that in which each one of us is living, for man’s destiny even at the humblest level, is to be an actor and not a spectator, and a man is an actor to the extent that he lives, feels, fights and loves. This hour of anxiety, confusion and struggle, this hour of conflict between great ideologies is a splendid and not a desperate hour. We are at the time just before the dawn and we should lose our deepest reason for living if, instead of awaiting with joy the new era which is to come, we met it with spirits torn by pessimism and doubt.

The United States'... recommendation will be that the whole matter go to a committee which will study all questions of U.N. reorganization until next year.

214. With regard to the problem of the Middle East, we feel the same concern as yesterday. It is essential that each of the parties to the dispute should contribute what it is its duty to contribute, what it is obliged to contribute, to further the desired negotiations that the world expects.
